\framesubtitle{Because A Slide-deck Is Not as Fun as A Fairy Tale!}
\label{slide:assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item We Wish Mathematics Were Fun to Thinking People Who Enjoy Fairy Tales, Rap Music, or Memes.
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Sadly, It Isn't!
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item However, This Slide-deck \alert{Isn't So Great to Make It So}!
\pause
\item We Therefore Expect That:
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item You Want to \alert{Explore Calculus of Your Own Accord}.
\pause
\item You Can \alert{Follow Logical {\tiny (Deductive, Inductive)} Arguments}.
\pause
\item You've Heard of \alert{Natural, Rational, Irrational, Real, Complex Numbers}.
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item You Understand How a Number Such as \alert{$\sqrt{2}$ Differs from} a Number Such as \alert{$1.737465$, 7, or $2+3i$}.
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item You \alert{Understand The Language of School Algebra}, And \alert{Can Solve Some `Equations'}. Learning \alert{Calculus before Algebra Isn't Helpful}!
\pause 
\item You Have Heard of \alert{`Functions'}, And Know Some of Them (e.g. \alert{Polynomial, Rational, Logarithmic, Exponential, and Trigonometric}).
\end{itemize}
