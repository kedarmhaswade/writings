You might have read in ../de-morgan-diff-integ-calc-illustrations/readme.txt that I abandoned that book (for now).

I worked hard on choosing a more lively book as an introductory calculus text.

And I found Silvanus P. Thompson's _Calculus Made Easy_, annotated by Martin Gardner.

I hope I continue "beemerizing" this book.

I have to admit that I underwent a mental turmoil in choosing an introductory calculus book. I referred to many references on this topic, and finally found Martin Gardner's introduction. I had to settle for it because it put my doubts to rest, and, more importantly, he had already done a dependable research to reassuringly piggyback upon (perhaps he also lamented the state of introductory calculus teaching). Here's how Gardner ends his introduction to this book:

---
I hope my revisions and additions for this newly revised edition of Calculus Made Easy will render it even easier to understand-not just for high school and college students, but also for older laymen who, like William James, long to know what calculus is all about. Most mathematics deals with static objects such as circles and triangles and numbers. But the great universe "out there," not made by us, is in a constant state of what Newton called flux. At every microsecond it changes magically into something different.

Calculus is the mathematics of change. If you are not a mathematician or scientist, or don't intend to become one, there is no need for you to master the techniques for solving calculus problems by hand. But if you avoid acquiring some insight into the essentials of calculus, into what James called its philosophy, you will miss a great intellectual adventure. You will miss an exhilarating glimpse into one of the most marvelous, most useful creations of those small and mysterious computers inside our heads.

Of course, I will take little detours for curious inquiry from time to time. I will also present helpful exposition to the best of my capacity. For such a study, a single resource is hardly enough; you need many of them.

I hope I follow through as Rujuta and I embark on our calculus ride; I am sure we'll have fun!
