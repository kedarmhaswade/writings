\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Newton's Influence (And Inexact Infinitesimal Calculus's Undeniable Effectiveness) Overcame Berkeley's Criticism.
\pause
\item For Almost Two Centuries, Naturalists Used \alert{``The Inexact'' Infinitesimal Calculus} to Solve Many Practical Problems in Physics.
\pause
\item Ultimately, A Pure Mathematician like Weierstrass Led The Efforts to \alert{Reinstate Rigor in Analysis (Calculus)} in The 19th Century.
\pause
\item Like Our Greek Ancestors, Weierstrass Formally Outlawed Infinitesimals by Perfecting an Intriguing Idea \dots
