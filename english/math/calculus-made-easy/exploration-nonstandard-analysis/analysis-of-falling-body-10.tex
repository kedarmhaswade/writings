\pause
\item On A First Reading, This \alert{Mere Replacement of $dt, ds$ by $\Delta t, \Delta s$ Feels Strange}. 
\pause
\item Granted, Weierstrass \alert{Achieved Two Important Things}:
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Removal of All Non-finite Quantities; \alert{Sticking to Reals}.
\pause
\item \alert{Avoiding Division by Zero}; He Never Sets $\Delta t$ in $\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ to 0.
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Addressed The Bishop's Concerns, But \alert{at What Price}?
\begin{itemize}
\item An Everyday, Intuitive (If Paradoxical) Quantity, Instantaneous Velocity, Is Subjected to Unrelated Real Numbers, $\epsilon,\delta$, A \alert{Surprisingly Subtle Notion of \textit{Limits}}.
\pause
\item \alert{Not Knowing Limits Didn't Keep The Bernoullis, Euler, \dots} From Finding Velocities in Complicated Cases.
\pause
\item We Knew The Answers Using Infinitesimals That Matched Answers Found By Limits. And Yet, For ``Logical Consistency'', We Embraced a Subtle Definition That Mathematicians Appreciate\footnote{\tiny Power of Proper Training?} Much More Than Common People. \alert{Did We Treat Infinitesimals Fairly}?
