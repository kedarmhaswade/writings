\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Weierstrass Formalized Calculus Using The Allegedly Non-intuitive Idea of \alert{Limits}.
\pause
\item However, In 1966, The Logician Abraham Robinson Reintroduced Infinitesimals And Provided The \alert{Necessary Rigor} to Them!
\pause
\item Several Mathematicians Criticized Robinson's Work!
\pause
\item But in 2020s, It Is Considered Original Body of Work That Is \alert{Equivalent To Standard Analysis}; Strangely, Logic Prevalent Now Necessitates Infinitesimals!
\pause
\item In The End, Your Approach to Calculus Reduces to \alert{Your Philosophy of Mathematics}: Choice Is Yours!
\pause
\item The War between \alert{The Continuous And The Discrete} Is Reignited.
