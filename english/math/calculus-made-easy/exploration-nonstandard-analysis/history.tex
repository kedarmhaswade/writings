\begin{itemize}
\item Influential Ancient Greeks, Euclid, Aristotle, \& Archimedes, \alert{Avoided The \textit{Unthinkable} Infinity (Infinitely Large) \& The \textit{Strange} Infinitesimals (Infinitely Small)}. 
\pause
\item Ideas of Calculus Over Time Culminated into \alert{Leibniz's and Newton's Formulation of Calculus} in The 1680s.
\pause
\item Both Used The \alert{\textit{Banned} Infinitesimals}:
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Small, \alert{Infinitely Small} Non-Archimedean Numbers!
\pause
\item Smaller Than Any Finite Number, Yet Bigger Than 0!
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Several Philosophers/Mathematicians Criticized\footnote{Prominent Among Them Was Bishop George Berkeley, The Famous Clergyman for Whom the University of Berkeley, California is Named!} Leibniz and Newton for These \textit{Infinitesimal Numbers} \alert{That Exist in A Sort of Neverland}!
\pause
\item Infinitesimals Defied \alert{Logic Prevalent at The Time}!
\pause
\item And So, Karl Weierstrass et. al. \alert{Banished Infinitesimals from Calculus by The 1890s}!
\end{itemize}
