\framesubtitle{Is That (\alert{Argument 1} [\ref{slide:rejected-by-euclid}]) A Valid Mathematical Proof?}
\label{slide:objections-to-nic}
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item That \textit{Argument} [\ref{slide:rejected-by-euclid}] Was Published by \alert {Nicholas of Cusa in The $15^{th}$ Century}!
\pause
\item We Wonder If It Is Even Logical! Clearly, \alert{Objections Galore}!
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item The \alert{Very Notion of A Triangle with An Infinitely Small Base Is Illusive}!
\pause
\item The Base of The Triangle, $b$, \alert{However Small}, Must Clearly Be $\geq0$, Right?
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $b=0$, \alert{No Number of Triangles Can Make A Circle with Positive Circumference}!
\item If $b>0$, \alert{Infinitely Many Triangles Make An Infinitely Large Circumference}!
\end{enumerate}
\pause
\item In Either Case, How Can We Ever Get \alert{A Finite Circle from Infinite Infinitely Small Pieces}?
\begin{enumerate}
\pause \item Every Real Number Must Be Archimedean!
\pause \item Since \alert{No Infinitesimal Is Archimedean}, They Were Rejected by Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes.
\end{enumerate}
