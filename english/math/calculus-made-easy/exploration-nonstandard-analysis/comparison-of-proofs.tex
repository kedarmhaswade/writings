\frametitle{Comparing The Two `Proofs'}
\framesubtitle{One Direct And One Indirect}
\label{slide:comparison-of-proofs}
We Have Two Proofs That $\mathbb{A}_C=\mathbb{H}_C$: The \alert{Direct Proof of Nicholas of Cusa [\ref{slide:rejected-by-euclid}] Using Infinitesimals} And The \alert{Indirect Argument of Archimedes [\ref{slide:arg-2-archimedes-5}] Avoiding Infinitesimals}!
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item The \alert{Direct Proof Is Strange}, The \alert {Indirect Proof Pedantic}!
\pause
\item They Agree And Reflect the `Beliefs' of Their Creators: Infinitesimals Made Archimedes Uncomfortable, But Inspired Nicholas of Cusa\footnote{Who Was A Cardinal of The Church}.
\pause
\item Nicholas of Cusa, Johannes Kepler, Blaise Pascal Reveled Mysticism of \alert{$\infty$}. Newton, Leibniz, Bernoulli Brothers, L'H\^{o}pital, Euler Vowed to Unravel It.
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Not Everyone Who Contributed to Formalizing Calculus Using Infinitesimals Believed Their Existence!
\pause
\item Newton Accepted \alert{But Avoided Them in \textit{Principia}}, Leibniz Accepted \alert{But Didn't Claim Their \textit{Existence}}!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
