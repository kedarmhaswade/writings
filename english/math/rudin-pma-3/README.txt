Rudin AMS-style LaTeX Template
==============================

Compile with:
  lualatex main.tex
or
  xelatex main.tex

This template is intentionally minimal and modeled after AMS journals:
- amsart document class
- Pagella for a book-like serif look
- Clean theorem environments
- No visual noise

Add exercises, solutions, or notes as you go.
