% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% [Kedar] I am keeping this structure, but abusing it to serve my purpose.
% [Kedar] I expect this `presentation' to have many hundred slides, if I end up doing it right.
% [Kedar] There are three sections per presentation, no subsections, but each section may have many, many slides. Let's see. I am just getting started with LaTeX and Beamer.
% [Kedar] I may roughly make a chapter in his book a section in this presentation.
