\label{slide:1.5-04}
I haven't read sufficiently about Robinson's inspiration to conceive hyperreal numbers. 

However, my rather mundane opinion on this is that, after all, infinitesimals had been practically successful. Many brilliant mathematicians used them to solve practical problems before Weierstrass's reformulation of calculus. What was missing was the rigor. Perhaps Robinson felt dearly about providing a rigorous treatment to something that worked effectively. That became his life's work.

We don't want to get completely lost in questions like ``Is Mathematics Invented or Discovered?'', but can we ignore them?
