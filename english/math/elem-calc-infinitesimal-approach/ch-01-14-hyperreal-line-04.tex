\label{slide:1.4-04}
\begin{itemize}
\item In Either Case (Slope, Velocity), The Intuitive Reasoning Fails to Clarify \alert{When Something Is to Be Treated Negligible}.
\pause\item We Need a \alert{Sharp Distinction} between \alert{Which Numbers Are Small Enough to Ignore And Which Aren't}.
\pause\item Actually, \alert{No \underline{Real Number} Except $0$ Is Small Enough To Ignore\footnote{Does This Hint at a New \textit{Kind} of Number?}}.
\pause\item To Address This Difficulty, We \alert{Take The Bold Step\footnote{A Rigorous Treatment Is Provided by Keisler in His \textit{Foundations}.} of Introducing a New \textit{Kind\footnote{Unreal?} of Number}} Which Is \alert{Infinitely Small And Yet $\ne 0$}.
