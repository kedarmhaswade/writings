\begin{block}{$x+\Delta x$ And $x$ Are Infinitely Close, But \dots}
$\Delta x$ Is An Infinitesimal. That Makes $x+\Delta x$ And $x$ Infinitely Close to Each Other.

But Unless We Have Precise Rules To Determine Which Hyperreal Numbers Are \alert{Infinitely Close} to Which Real Numbers, We Won't Be Able to Go Too Far.
