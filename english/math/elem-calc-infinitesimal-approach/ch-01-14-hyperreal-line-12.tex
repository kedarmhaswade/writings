\label{slide:1.4-12}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\alert{$\Delta x$ Is An Infinitesimal. That Brings $x+\Delta x$ Infinitely Close to $x$.}

\pause \item However, It Is Not Immediately Clear That $3x^2+3x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2$ Is Infinitely Close to $3x^2$, Is It?
\pause \item It Depends on Whether $3x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2$ Is Infinitesimal. We Only Know $\Delta x$ to Be Infinitesimal. Does That Make $3x^2+3x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2$ Infinitesimal?

\pause\item Thus, Unless We Have Precise Rules To Determine Which Hyperreal Numbers Are \alert{Infinitely Close} to Which Real Numbers, We Won't Be Able to Go Too Far.

\alert{That's What We Study Next}.
