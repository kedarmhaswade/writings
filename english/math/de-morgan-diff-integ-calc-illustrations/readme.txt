Update on 22 Aug 2025.
---------------------

I started enthusiastically with De Morgan's book. It's well-written, but it started to feel difficult as an introductory calculus book. 

I started the project of "beemerizing" the book on 10 Aug 2025. 

I abandoned that project on 22 Aug 2025.

I will, of course, keep reading the book, and, perhaps someday, will resurrect this project.
