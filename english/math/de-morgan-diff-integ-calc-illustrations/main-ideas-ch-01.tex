% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% [Kedar] I am keeping this structure, but abusing it to serve my purpose.
% [Kedar] I expect this `presentation' to have many hundred slides, if I end up doing it right.
% [Kedar] There are three sections per presentation, no subsections, but each section may have many, many slides. Let's see. I am just getting started with LaTeX and Beamer.
% [Kedar] I may roughly make a chapter in his book a section in this presentation.

Here Is A Definition!
\pause
\begin{definition}[Commensurable]
Two Magnitudes or Lengths or Measures Are Commensurable If They Can Be Expressed in Whole Numbers of Some Common Unit.
\label{def:commensurable}
\end{definition}

{\tiny To Recap [\ref{slide:commensurablerecap}]}
{\tiny To Modern Language [\ref{slide:modernlanguage}]}

\pause
Note: The Common Unit Can Be Made As Small or As Big As We Please.

\pause

Note: Mensurable Means Measurable.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Commensurable}
That Is a Mouthful,

\pause 

And Sounds Complicated!

\pause

But We Can Deconstruct it Slowly \dots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: Commensurable}
Consider An Example!
\begin{example}
`Foot' and `Yard' Are Units of Length.

\pause

1 Foot is \textbf{Commensurable} with 1 Yard. 

\pause

1 Foot = 12 Inches and 1 Yard = 36 Inches
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item If the ``Common Unit'' is 3 (Inches), then 1 Foot Is \textbf{4} Common Units and 1 Yard Is \textbf{12} Common Units. Both 4 and 12 are Whole Numbers.
\pause
\item If the ``Common Unit'' is 6 (Inches), then 1 Foot Is \textbf{2} Common Units and 1 Yard = \textbf{6} Common Units. Both 2 and 6 are Whole Numbers.
\pause
\item If the ``Common Unit'' is 1 (Inch), then 1 Foot Is \textbf{12} Common Units and 1 Yard Is \textbf{36} Common Units. Both 12 and 36 are Whole Numbers.
\pause
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: Commensurable}
We \textit{Showed} That, with A Choice of 3 Common Units
\footnote{Although the Definition Requires Just One},

\pause

(The Lengths) 1 Foot and 1 Yard Are Commensurable.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: Commensurable}
Consider Another Example!
\begin{example}
SFO $\rightarrow$ NYC is a 6-Hour Flight.\\
SFO $\rightarrow$ DTW is a $5\frac{1}{2}$-Hour Flight.

Are These Two Periods, or Lengths of Time: $T_1=6,T_2=5\frac{1}{2}$, Commensurable?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item What is Your Common Unit?
\pause
\item How Many Whole Numbers of That Common Unit Are $T_1,T_2$?
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: Commensurable}

Very Well Then! 

\pause

To Show That Two Lengths Are Commensurable, We Find A Common Unit and Demonstrate That Each Length Equals Some Whole Number Times It.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: Commensurable}

You Are Convinced That $T_1=6,T_2=5\frac{1}{2}$ Are Commensurable, Right?

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Lengths?}
We Say `Lengths' Because Humanity Measured Things Since Antiquity.

\pause

We Also Say `Magnitudes'.

\pause

Like In Everyday Language, We Use `Length' and `Magnitude' \textit{Synonymously}.

\pause

Geometry Played A Big Role in Our Understanding of Mathematics \dots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Sometimes, However, Counterexamples Are Helpful Too.

\framesubtitle{The proof uses \textit{reductio ad absurdum}.}
\begin{theorem}
There is no largest prime number.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
\item<2-> Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
\item<3-> Then $q + 1$ is not divisible by any of them.
\item<1-> But $q + 1$ is greater than $1$, thus divisible by some prime
number not in the first $p$ numbers.\qedhere
