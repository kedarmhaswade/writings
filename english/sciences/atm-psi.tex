\title{Atmospheric Pressure and Its American Unit}

\textbf{Practical Problem}: 
How do you specify 1 atmospheric pressure in the USA?

\textbf{Solution}:
We won't go into why the USA keeps the FPS system of measurement, but instead, focus on the problem as it is faced by a young and hapless student of science.

In the USA, pressure, which is force per unit area, is expressed in \textbf{pound-force/in\textsuperscript{2}}, \textbf{lbf/in\textsuperscript{2}}, or \textbf{psi} in short. Note that the `p' in psi stands for \emph{pound-force} and not pound, although informally it is taken that way (i.e. pound/in\textsuperscript{2}). If you ask a random person in America they might say that the unit of pressure there is ``\emph{pound} per square inch". Historical aspects of the resulting mess are described in \cite{esu}.

As if this were not confusing enough, the definition of \textbf{1 pound-force} or \textbf{1 lbf} was defined as the \emph{weight} of 1 pound \emph{mass}\footnote{We feel sorry for those who were taught in a manner to treat mass and weight interchangeably.} on the surface of earth! This was really short-sighted. Anyway, the weight $W$ in \textbf{lbf} of \textbf{1 pound mass} (or 454 \si{\gram} or 0.454 \si{\kg}) on the surface of earth, is 
\begin{align*}
    W 
    &= mg \dots \footnotemark\\
    &= 1\times 9.8 \; \text{lb m/s\textsuperscript{2}} \\
    &= 0.454\times 9.8\; \text{kg m/s\textsuperscript{2}}\\
    &= 4.4492\; \text{N} \dots \footnotemark
\end{align*}
Thus, \textbf{1 lbf} force is equivalent to \textbf{4.448 \si{\newton}}.

Then, 
\begin{align*}
    1 \; \text{psi} 
    &= 1 \; \text{lbf/in\textsuperscript{2}} \\
    &= 4.4492 \; \text{N/in\textsuperscript{2}} \\
    &= 4.4492 \times 39.37 \times 39.37\; \text{N/m\textsuperscript{2}} \\
    &= 6896.246 \; \si{\pascal}
\end{align*}
Pascal: \si{\pascal} is the SI unit of pressure. Since 1 atomospheric pressure is 101325 \si{\pascal}, from the above we get:
\begin{align*}
    1 \; \text{atm} 
    &= \frac{101325}{6896.246} \;\text{psi} \\
    &= 14.693 \; \text{psi}
\end{align*}

That's it. 1 atmospheric pressure is 14.693 psi.
