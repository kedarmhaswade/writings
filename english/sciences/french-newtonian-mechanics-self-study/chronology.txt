- Started doing hors douevres exercises.
- Referred to <i>Physics for the Inquiring Mind</i> by Eric Rogers.

05 March 2021
- Went through physicsforums.com for the book recommendations.
- Decided that I need to cover Newtonian Mechanics, Waves and vibrations, and Electromagnetism in roughtly three months.
- Chose A. P. French's book.
- Downloaded History of Physics by Max Von Laue. This sounds dry, although it appears to be a true account of the past events up to 1940.
