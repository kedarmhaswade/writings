This short doc records dated events for studying the Newtonian Mechanics from A. P. French's book. The events are arranged counter-chronologically.

- Started doing hors douevres exercises.
- Referred to <i>Physics for the Inquiring Mind</i> by Eric Rogers.

05 March 2021
- Went through physicsforums.com for the book recommendations.
- Decided that I need to cover Newtonian Mechanics, Waves and vibrations, and Electromagnetism.
- Chose A. P. French's book.
- Downloaded History of Physics by Max Von Laue. This sounds dry, although it appears to be a true account of the past events up to 1940.

- Clearly this is taking way too much time, but it appears worth it.
- Reading about Time and Frequency. The two books by NBS/NIST are really interesting: 
  -- Byron Blair edited Time and Frequency: Theory and Fundamentals
  -- Jespersen and Fitz-Randolph: From Sundials to Atomic Clocks
