I picked up \href{https://www.amazon.in/Samskrta-Subodhini-Sanskrit-Michigan-Southeast-Studies/dp/089148079X}{Professor Madhav Deshpande's book} in November 2020. These are my notes from his book. While studying from his book, I explored a variety of relevant resources available on the WWW. These notes rely heavily on those wonderful resources. These notes are a unification of what I could find on various topics as seen from my perspective.

\section{Introduction}

The book begins with an overview of Sanskrit that we shall cover below. It touches upon the language's history and evolution, writing system, sounds, grammar, and syntax.
    
\subsection{Grammar}
Sanskrit (\sans{sa.msk.rta}), like Greek and Latin, is an \emph{inflected} language. This means it shows \emph{alteration in form especially by adding affixes}. The bulk of grammatical information is carried by morphology (i.e. the rules for forming admissible words).

    A \emph{morpheme} which is the minimal meaningful language unit, is of one of these types:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item nominal stem (adjectives, pronouns, and indeclinables(\sans{avyayam}))
            \begin{itemize}
                \item primary 
                \item secondary 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item derived from other nominals via affixation (e.g. \sans{kuru} + \sans{a = kaurava, nara} + \sans{tva = naratva})
                        \item derived from verbal roots via affixation (e.g. \sans{gam} + \sans{ana = gamana, k.r} + \sans{t.r = kart.r})
                        \item compounds (e.g. \sans{nara} + \sans{pati = narapati, cakra} + \sans{paa.ni = cakrapaa.ni})
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
        \item verbal root (\sans{dhaatu.h})
            \begin{itemize}
                \item primary
                \item secondary
            \end{itemize}
        \item indeclinables (\sans{avyayam})
            \begin{itemize}
                \item particles (e.g. \sans{upari})
                \item pre-positions (e.g. \sans{adhi, pari, anu})
                \item post-positions
                \item adverbs (e.g. \sans{satatam})
                \item connectives (e.g. \sans{ca, vaa})
                \item (occasionally) nouns
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    The nominal stem is characterized by gender as an \emph{intrinsic property} and it is grammatical, usually unrelated to semantics (though the living beings are usually masculine or feminine). There are three genders:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item masculine,
        \item feminine, and
        \item neuter
    \end{itemize}
    
\hypertarget{generic-gender}{Between} masculine and feminine, the former is \emph{generic}, meaning it takes precedence. For pronouns, neuter is the most generic.

    Declension of nouns (as we shall later see, declension serves the same purpose that prepositions serve in English) is affected by several factors such as 
    their 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item gender (masculine, feminine, neuter), 
        \item final sound or sounds of the stem (e.g. \sans{akaaraanta, n-kaaraanta}), 
        \item number (singular, dual, and plural), and 
        \item case (\sans{prathamaa}: nominative -- I, \sans{dvitiiyaa}: accusative -- II, \sans{t.rtiiyaa}: instrumental -- III, \sans{caturthii}: dative -- IV, \sans{pa~ncamii}: ablative -- V, \sans{.sa.s.Tii}: genitive -- VI, \sans{saptamii}: locative -- VII, \sans{sambodhanam}: vocative -- VIII). The following list may help describe the usual purpose of cases:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item nominative -- serving as or indicating the \emph{subject} of the verb (\sans{kartaa})
                \item accusative -- serving as or indicating the \emph{(direct) object} of the verb (\sans{karma})
                \item instrumental -- serving or acting as a \emph{means} or aid (\sans{saadhana, kara.na})
                \item dative -- serving as the \emph{(indirect) object} or the recipient (beneficiary) of the action of the verb (\sans{sampradaanam})
                \item ablative -- indicating the \emph{source or separation} of the agent, instrument, or location (\sans{apaadaanam})
                \item genitive -- expressing \emph{ownership} (--)
                \item locative -- designating the \emph{place or state or action} denoted by the verb (\sans{adhikara.nam})
                \item vocative -- identifying the person being \emph{addressed} (\sans{sambodhanam})
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    Here is the declension of a masculine \sans{akaaraanta} word \sans{deva}:

    The verbal system is more complex and in the vedic system it is even more so [than the classical system]. The book describes complexities of the vedic verbal system and mentions that classical verbal system gradually got rid of a lot of constructs from the former.
    
    Here is an overview of the complexities of the grammar of the vedic language:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Verb roots (\sans{dhaatava.h}) are generally of two types: \emph{athematic} and \emph{thematic}. 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Athematic: Variable accent\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)}{Accent or Stress} in linguistics is the relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable (unit of speech sounds) in a word or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence} and variable stem to which \emph{terminations are directly attached} (e.g. \sans{as $+$ ti = asti})
                \item Thematic: Invariable accent and invariable stem followed by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_vowel}{thematic vowel} \sans{a} before the termination (e.g. \sans{budh $+$ a $+$ ti = bodhati}). This helps make various verb forms more regular as the complex interactions between the root-final consonant and suffix-initial vowel are prevented by the intervening \sans{a}.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item A verb has a single \emph{root}, however, in Vedic Samskritam it may have many \emph{stems}\footnote{A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem\#Usage}{stem} is that part of a word that inflectional affixes attach to}. Consider the following forms (root, stem, affixes) with respect to a single verbal root \sans{gam} which means ``to go". Forms depend upon \emph{voice}, \emph{number}, and \emph{person} of the \emph{agent} (\sans{kartaa}), but for brevity, we show the form only\footnote{See \href{https://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktconjug.cgi?q=gam;c=1;font=roma}{here} for a programmatic interface to all the forms of \sans{gam}} for the singular (\sans{ekavacanam}), active (\sans{kartari}) voice, and third person (\sans{prathama puru.sa.h}):
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Tenses:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Present (\sans{la.t -- gacchati})
                        \item Aorist\footnote{There are \href{https://avagraha.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/sanskrit-aorist/}{several aorist tense forms} in Samskritam} (expressing action (especially past action) without indicating its completion or continuation) \href{https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/Sanskrit_Language_Tools/verbs/the-aorist/}{(\sans{lu"n -- agamat})}
                        \item Imperfect Past (\sans{la"n -- agacchat})
                        \item Perfect (\sans{li.t -- jagaama})
                        \item Future (\sans{l.l.t -- gami.syati})
                    \end{enumerate}
                \item Moods: 
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Indicative (simple declarations) (\sans{la.t -- gacchati})
                        \item Injunctive (could indicate \emph{intention}) (\sans{jigamat})
                        \item Subjunctive (typically used to express various states of reality such as wish, emotion, judgment etc.)
                        \item Optative (wish, request, or command) (\sans{gacchet})
                        \item Imperative (command or request) (\sans{gacchatu})
                    \end{enumerate}
                \item Meanings of the \emph{present tense} stems:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Indicative (simple declarations)(\sans{la.t -- gacchati})
                        \item Intensive (denotes stronger, more forceful, or more concentrated action relative to the root on which the intensive is built) (\sans{ja"ngamyate})
                    \end{enumerate}
                \item Participle forms indicating tenses and voices (these forms depend on the gender of the nominal they modify):
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Past Passive (\sans{gata, gataa})
                        \item Past Active (\sans{gatavat, gatavatii})
                        \item Present Active (\sans{gacchat, gacchantii})
                        \item Present Middle (\sans{gacchamaana, gacchamaanaa})
                        \item Present Passive (\sans{gamyamaana, gamyamaanaa})
                        \item \dots
                    \end{enumerate}
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Verb conjugations could also be one of
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Primary
                \item Causative
                \item Intensive
                \item Desiderative (a verb formed from another and expressing a desire to do the act denoted by the root verb)
            \end{enumerate}
        \item All of this clearly means that the number of derived forms was very large. See Table \ref{tab: verb conjugations} for a more complete list of verb conjugations and related forms.
    \end{enumerate}

    The verbal form complexity was greatly reduced in the classical language.
    The so-called \sans{lakaaraa.h} show a glimpse of a plethora of forms that a verbal root leads to:
    \begin{center}
        \label{verse: lakaaraa.h}
        \sans{
        la.t vartamaane le.t vede bhuute la"n lu"n li.tastathaa | \\
        vidhyaa"si.sostu li"nlo.tau lu.t l.r.t l.r"n ca bhavi.syati ||
    }
    \end{center}


    The language evolved to favor nominal sentences over verbal sentences. 


    The most remarkable feature of the classical language is the \emph{compounds} (especially their phenomenal length). Here is an example from Jayadeva's \sans{giitagovinda}: 
    \begin{center}
        \sans
        {
        candanacarcitaniilakalevarapiitavasanavanamaalii|\\
        kelicalanma.niku.n.dalama.n.dita ga.n.dayuga.h smita"saalii||\\
    }
    \end{center}

  The author believes that several changes occurred to the vedic Sanskrit that Panini grammarized. There was also the influence of local languages. In spite of that, because of Panini's efforts, the language established itself as an ``elite language''. In such evolution, the language's \emph{surface form}s\footnote{Surface form of a word is the form of a word as it appears in the text (e.g. ``goes'' is a surface form of the verb ``go''). Contrast it with the \href{https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Lexical_form}{lexical form} which consists of things such as the root, the part of speech etc.} were retained.

        The \sans{sa.msk.rta} Alphabet
}
\subsection{Basics}
\subsubsection{Vowels (when not combined with consonants)}
\eng{
    There are 13 vowels of which 5 are \textcolor{red}{short} (\textsanskrit{r+hasva}) and 8 are \textcolor{blue}{long} (\textsanskrit{diirgha}). Not combined with consonants, here they are:
}

\begin{table}[hbp]
\begin{center}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
In addition to these 13 \emph{independent} vowels, there are two ``add-on signs" that, like other vowels, conjugate with consonants:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \sans{.m} -- \sans{anusvaara.h} 
    \item \sans{.h} -- \sans{visarga.h}
\end{enumerate}

One last vowel-like letter is \sans{``avagraha"} which elongates the pronunciation of a preceding vowel:
\sans{.a}. The independent vowels conjugate with consonants and create ``add-on signs" that we will see below.

There are 33 consonants and 2 special consonant clusters. The arrangement is according to the location and mechanism of sound production:

Table \ref{tab: phonetic} shows the \emph{phonetic analysis} of the Sanskrit Alphabet. In that table, `Voice' feature refers to \emph{sonorous vibration}, `Asp' (aspiration) feature refers to a \emph{rush of air}, and `Nasal' refers to sound generation with the passage of air through nose (and not mouth\footnote{Nearly all nasal consonants are nasal occlusives, in which air escapes through the nose but not through the mouth, as it is blocked (occluded) by the lips or tongue.}). If a feature is present, a `+' preceeds it (e.g. `+Voice' -- generation of a sonorous vibration) and if a `-' preceeds it, that feature is absent (e.g. `-Asp' -- no rush of air).

Figure \ref{fig: places-of-articulation} (taken from Wikipedia) shows the places where the sound is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation}{produced} in its audible form\footnote{Articulation means the aspect of pronunciation that involves bringing articulatory (speech) organs together so as to shape the sounds of speech.}.

We have already seen the Sanskrit alphabet in Tables \ref{tab: vowels} and \ref{tab: consonants}. In the written form, when one consonant conjugates with one vowel, we see an alternate representation. For example, when \sans{ka} combines with \sans{i}, the resulting conjugate is written as \sans{ki} and not \sans{ka.i}.

These are collectively called the ``add-on vowel signs" and they look like below (note that each of them has a Unicode codepoint which means that it is recognized as a distinct character in a writing system (in this case \sans{devanaagarii})). There is no add-on vowel sign for \sans{a}; when conjugated with \sans{a}, the consonant simply loses the \sans{viraama.h} -- \sans{\char"94D}. Any consonant should conjugate with these add-ons, the Table \ref{tab: add-on vowels} below uses `\sans{t}' as an example.

Thus the representation of a single consonant like \sans{pa} is a combination of the base consonant \sans{p} and the vowel \sans{a}. This document treats \sans{pa} and \sans{p} interchangeably unless noted otherwise. The word \sans{kaara.h} in Samskritam grammar denotes the sound associated with a letter or (occassionally,) a word. For example, when the vowel \sans{aa} combines with any consonant an \sans{aakaara.h} results, when the vowel \sans{u} combines with any consonant an \sans{ukaara.h} results, and so on.

Consonants combine with the vowels to form the conjugate forms as in Table \ref{tab: add-on vowels}. Thus, with another consonant, \sans{g}, the forms will be written: \sans{ga, gaa, gi, gii, gu, guu, g.r, g.R, g.l, ge, gai, go, gau, ga.m, ga.h}. There are few exceptions in writing these forms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sans{r $+$ u $=$ ru}
    \item \sans{r $+$ uu $=$ ruu}
    \item \sans{r $+$ .r $=$ r.r}
    \item \sans{r $+$ .R $=$ r.R}
    \item \sans{h $+$ .r $=$ h.r}
\end{itemize}

When two or more consonants occur successively without any intervening vowels, they are written in a conjoined form: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Horizontal cluster (read $\textrm{left}\rightarrow\textrm{right}$): $\;\;\makebox[0pt]{\overrightarrow{\textrm{ccc}}}$
    \item Vertical cluster (read $\textrm{top}\rightarrow\textrm{bottom}$): \mystack{c c c}{\downarrow}
\end{itemize}
The rules for making consonant clusters depend (mostly) on whether the first consonant has a vertical line from top to bottom or a short central stem from which character is suspended:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a horizontal cluster, the final vertical lines of all but the last consonant are dropped and then the remaining parts are joined together: \sans{v $+$ ya = vya}, \sans{.s $+$ p $+$ ya $=$ .spya}, \sans{s $+$ t $+$ vaa $=$ stvaa}
    \item Characters suspended from a central stem have several forms: \sans{.t $+$ .ta $=$ .t.ta, d $+$ da $=$ dda, .d $+$ .da $=$ .d.da, l $+$ la $=$ lla}
    \item Other combinations are handled in various ways: \sans{.t $+$ ya $=$ .tya, d $+$ ya $=$ dya, k $+$ ya $=$ kya, k $+$ ta $=$ kta}. When \sans{l} is the second consonant, it may be placed next to (\sans{g $+$ la $=$ gla}) or below (\sans{k $+$ la $=$ kla}) the first consonant.
    \item Special forms: \sans{"s} and \sans{r}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For \sans{"s}, alternate combining form may be used: \sans{"sca, "sna, "sra, "sva} etc. or \sans{"s} may be retained: \sans{"ska, "sta, "sma} etc. But with \sans{ra} it is always \sans{"sra}, never as \includegraphics[height=\fontcharht\font`\B]{wrong-shra.png}.
            \item \sans{r} has several combining forms.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item When \sans{r} is the second consonant:
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item First consonant has a vertical line: \sans{p $+$ ra $=$ pra, k $+$ ra $=$ kra, b $+$ ra $=$ bra}, but there are special forms: \sans{t $+$ ra $=$ tra, k $+$ ra $=$}\includegraphics[height=\fontcharht\font`\B]{kra.png}.
                            \item First consonant has a central stem: \sans{.t $+$ ra $=$ .tra, .d $+$ ra $=$ .dra} etc. Note the exception: \sans{d $+$ ra $=$ dra}.
                        \end{enumerate}
                    \item When \sans{r} is the first consonant: This gives rise to \sans{repha.h}. Examples: \sans{r $+$ ka $=$ rka, r $+$ ma $=$ rma, r $+$ ko $=$ rko}.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

There are defined consonant clusters (different from the special consonant clusters \sans{k $+$ .sa $=$ k.sa, j $+$ ~na $=$ j~na} that are part of the alphabet) like: \sans{kka, kkha, kca, k.na, \dots, k.sma, "nkta, "nkhya, \dots, dga, ddha, dbha, dma, dvya}. Upon careful observation, one can see several similarities and some anomalies in the way letters of the \sans{devanaagarii} script are written. One reason is, of course, evolution of the language and the script due to socioeconomic circumstances (e.g. ease of writing). Still, one generally makes no mistake in identifying a piece of text written in some script. In other words, how humans identify a certain script and letters in it is a matter of scientific research. Describing unambinguously how to write a symbol of a script is challenging. Think of \emph{teaching a computer} how to write, for example, \sans{ka} and you will perhaps appreciate the difficulty involved. 

Generally speaking, a document (like this one) with \sans{devanaagarii} letters that has been typeset on a computer (or in a traditional printing press), the letters (especially the combined ones) are dictated by the \emph{font} used. Thus, all of the above letters that you see are defined by the artist(s) who created the font. The \sans{devanaagarii} letters in this document use a font named Shobhika(\sans{"sobhikaa}) which is developed by the \href{https://github.com/Sandhi-IITBombay/Shobhika}{Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India}.

There aren't very many punctuation marks in Samskritam. The few that are used consistently are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \sans{viraama.h -- \char"94D} that denotes a bare consonant (without the terminal vowel \sans{a}).
    \item \sans{da.n.da.h -- |} that marks the end of a sentence or the end of half a stanza: \sans{raama.h g.rha.m gacchati|}
    \item \sans{da.n.dau -- ||} that marks the end of a stanza.
\end{enumerate}

According to Prof. Deshpande, in modern editions of Sanskrit texts, other English punctuation marks like `,', `!', and `?' are found.

\subsection{On Transliteration}
\epigraph
{
    Perhaps of all the creations of man language is the most astonishing.

    --\textit{Giles Lytton Strachey \cite{wap}}

Associated with every human language are sounds and symbols. A distinguishable sound is called \href{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme}{phoneme} whereas a distinguishable symbol is called \href{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme}{grapheme} or character. Every language has a script which is used to represent the characters and words in that language. The basic set of symbols of a script is its alphabet. English words, for instance, are represented by a sequence of symbols of the augmented English alphabet. The alphabet is augmented to include punctuation signs, numbers, and other symbols. These symbols are collectively referred to as the ``character set" of a writing system. 

A sequence of English characters (from `a' to `z' and from `A' to `Z') to represent a word (e.g. ``student") is called the spelling of that word. \emph{Spelling} or native spelling of a word tells us how to \emph{write the sounds} of any word in a language using the (native) script of that language so that the written communication can become possible. 

\href{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration}{Transliteration} refers to the conversion of graphemes or characters or symbols from one script to another. Although the focus of transliteration is on symbols (and not on sounds), sounds are given due consideration and symbols that sound similar are chosen for conversion. For example, the \sans{devanaagarii} symbol \sans{`ra'} is typically transliterated to the English symbol `r' or a pair of symbols ``ra". Such use of transliteration has been made more ubiquitous by smartphone apps (for instance in India) that provide a messaging interface that lets users \emph{quickly} key in English spellings of their native language (e.g. Marathi, Hindi, or Samskritam) words which are seamlessly renderred in a native script like \sans{devanaagarii}. 

In general, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: transliterator}, transliteration refers to conversion of text from a \emph{source} script to a \emph{target} script. Thus, in transliteration, two different scripts or ``character sets" are involved: a source character set and a target character set. Typically, these sets are \emph{disjoint}, that is, there is no character (excluding trivial characters like a blank -- ` ') that is a member of both the character sets. It should be clear that we undertake transliteration so that you can (at least) recognize certain text that was written in an unfamiliar character set. By reading the transliterated text, you can reproduce sounds that are \emph{close} to the \emph{sounds} that the source text actually represents, \textbf{without knowing the symbols from the source character set}. 

You may ask: ``Why should transliteration be attempted at all?" It is indeed possible to take an approach like ``The \emph{native script} of any text is inseparable from its language. Therefore learn the native script to understand how that text is written and read." and altogether remove the need for transliteration\footnote{A similar argument could also be made about the \emph{need for translating} texts from one language into another}, but such an approach is too restrictive; transliteration facility may provide people with additional means to analyze languages and their scripts. After all, transliteration between two scripts is expected to be simpler than translation between associated languages.

We can examine the \emph{process of transliteration} in more detail. Suppose you want to read the Samskritam sentence in \sans{devanaagarii} -- \sans{raama.h vanam agacchat|} -- but you have not learned the \sans{devanaagarii} script and you are only familiar with the English alphabet\footnote{When the target script uses the English alphabet, transliteration is often referred to as \emph{romanization}.} and a few more characters like period -- `.', blank or space -- ` ', colon -- `:' etc. How might you \emph{read} that sentence then? 

One way to do this may be to split the sentence -- let's call it the \emph{input sentence} -- into words at \emph{word boundaries}. Each word is, in turn, a sequence of characters in the source character set. Once such ``character segregation" of the input sentence is done, we can create an unambiguous, \emph{one to one} mapping from each character to one or more target characters. Such a system, shown in Figure \ref{fig: transliterator}, is a simple and functional \emph{one-way interpreter} of symbols. A one to one mapping means that \emph{every symbol} from the source character set is associated with a unique sequence of symbols from the target character set. An illustration of such a mapping is shown in Figure \ref{fig: injective-mapping-chars}. Our system may maintain a table of symbol mappings and simply \emph{look up} the target symbol(s) for the source symbol that it encounters in the input sentence. Once the corresponding characters are \emph{emitted} by our interpreter, the resulting sentence -- let's call it the \emph{output sentence} -- will be automatically constructed.

    \caption{One to One Mapping Between Example Character Sets}
    \label{fig: injective-mapping-chars}
\end{figure}

Let us examine this process for our example sentence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input sentence is \sans{raama.h vanam agacchat|}. It is made of \emph{exactly} 18 characters in the following order: \sans{`ra', \char2366, `ma', `.h',` ', `va', `na', `ma', `\&', ` ', `a', `ga', `ca', `\&', `cha', `ta', `\&', `|'}
    \item Inspired by Figure \ref{fig: injective-mapping-chars} we devise a mapping in Table \ref{tab: example-mapping} that we look up as we deal with the input characters.
    \item Output sentence then becomes: raaamaH vanam{\textbackslash} Agacha{\textbackslash}chhat{\textbackslash}|
\end{itemize}

\begin{table} [h!]

        \hline
    \end{longtable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Although our transliterator seems to work, it is rather simplistic since it just looks up characters. If the input characters were such that there is an inherent ambiguity, then our scheme based on a symbol lookup may not work reliably. Fortunately the \sans{devanaagarii} characters are free from such ambiguity and contextual knowledge is not needed to perform a reliable transliteration on \emph{any} \sans{devanaagarii} text provided to our transliterator.

However, consider a reverse transliteration problem. It would be fair to expect the original \sans{devanaagarii} text -- \sans{raama.h vanam agacchat|} -- back with our transliterator when it is given the input -- raaamaH vanam{\textbackslash} Agacha{\textbackslash}chhat{\textbackslash}| -- as shown in Figure \ref{fig: transliterator2}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{transliterator2.png}
    \caption{A Two-way Transliterator}
    \label{fig: transliterator2}
\end{figure}

It is not immediately clear if our lookup table based approach would behave ``reversibly" as we expect. At the least, since we do \emph{not} have mapping for characters like `r', `m' etc. (but only for character pairs like ``ra"$\rightarrow$\sans{`ra'}, ``ma"$\rightarrow$\sans{`ma'}) that show up in the new \emph{input sentence}, our lookups are likely to fail. Thus, at times we need to read pairs of input characters (e.g. ``ra") and at other times we need to read single input characters like `A'. It seems mandatory that we introduce a notion of \emph{context} into our scheme in order to address the ambiguity and make our transliterator reversible, or symmetric.

A computer program is well-suited to carry out a rather informal \emph{specification} we have laid out for transliteration. Clearly, we need to formalize our specification in order for the computer program to work reliably when it is presented with \emph{any} \sans{devanaagarii} text for transliteration that it can recreate in a two-way operation. In computer parlance, transliteration is akin to \emph{encoding} and \emph{decoding} which are, by definition, symmetric.

There are many popular transliteration schemes for the romanization of the \sans{devanaagarii} text:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item International Alphabet of Sanskrit Translation (IAST) \cite{iast}
    \item Velthuis Transliteration (VLTH) \cite{velthuis}
\end{enumerate}

Typeset in {\LaTeX} this document uses the Velthuis scheme for transliteration of \sans{devanaagarii} text using only English letters. In Velthuis scheme, for example, \sans{devanaagarii} is transliterated as ``devanaagarii".

I believe that the book uses IAST transliteration scheme. Professor Deshpande asks us to transliterate between \sans{devanaagarii} and English. I am going to skip that exercise here.

\section{First Conjugation (\sans{ga.na}) of Active Verbs in Present Tense}

Since \sans{sa.msk.rta} is an \emph{inflected} language, verbs are inflected forms of their \emph{roots}. The root of a verb is called its \sans{dhaatu\footnote{\eng{The \emph{uninflected} state (before receiving case terminations) of a noun is called its \sans{praatipadika}. We will try to be consistent about the use of \sans{praatipadika} in this document.}}}. 

\emph{Conjugation} means inflection (change in the form) of a word. It also means a group or class of verbs whose inflection formation follow the same rules. However, this document will use the word \sans{ga.na} (and its plural \sans{ga.naa.h}) to refer to a group or class (or groups) of verbs and the word \emph{conjugation} to refer to inflection. We hope that avoiding the overloading of terms helps clarity. Thus, we will use \sans{ga.na - 1} to mean the first group of verbal roots.

Another ingredient of the (final) inflected form of a \sans{dhaatu} is its \emph{termination} or \emph{ending}. There are two types of termination: active and middle. The term \emph{active} is also overloaded in that it may refer to either the ending of a verb or the \emph{voice} of a sentence. To aid clarity, we will use \sans{parasmaipada} to refer to active termination and \sans{aatmanepada} to refer to middle termination (we may use the word ``middle" when referring to an ending as it is not ambiguous). A \sans{dhaatu} using \sans{parasmaipada} ending is called \sans{parasmaipadii dhaatu} whereas a \sans{dhaatu} using \sans{aatmanepada} ending is called \sans{aatmanepadii dhaatu}. Some verbal roots can use either \sans{parasmaipada} endings or \sans{aatmanepada} endings. Such a \sans{dhaatu} is called \sans{ubhayapadii dhaatu} (note, however, that there are no \sans{ubhayapadii} \emph{endings}).

A verbal root belongs to one of the 10 \sans{ga.naa.h}. Of these, the first, fourth, sixth, and tenth \sans{ga.naa.h} form a related group. In this section, we illustrate the first \sans{ga.na}.  We will generally annotate a \sans{dhaatu} as \sans{\{naama\} (\{1..10\}-pa|aa|u)}. For example, the \sans{bhuu dhaatu} is denoted as \sans{bhuu (1-pa)}. A complete conjugation of a verbal root is a complete specification of the seven parameters from list \ref{list: conjugation parameters}. These could be thought of as \emph{dimensions}. Some or all of the first five are specified by name and a table or matrix of 3 rows and 3 columns is formed between the remaining two where the rows belong to the person and columns belong to the number of an inflection. Such a table can be prepared for each of the \sans{dhaatu}. In addition to this, there are affixes \sans{(pratyaya)} that behave like nominal forms but indicate action. This is what is \emph{grammatically} possible. Not every grammatical inflected form is used by authors in \sans{sa.msk.rta} literature, however.  But you can easily see the enormous expressive power and complexity this adds to the language. For a more complete conjugation specification, see Table \ref{tab: verb conjugations}.


\begin{captionedlabeledlistenv}{Conjugation Parameters}\label{list: conjugation parameters}
    \item \emph{group} or \emph{class} of the verbal root \sans{(dhaatuga.na)}. There are 10 \sans{ga.naa.h} represented by numbers 1 through 10.
    \item \emph{termination} or \emph{ending} of the form. There are two: active \sans{(parasmaipada)} and middle \sans{(aatmanepada)}.
    \item \emph{tense} or \emph{mood} of the action (\sans{lakaara}). In classical \sans{sa.msk.rta}, there are 10. See \ref{verse: lakaaraa.h}.
    \item \emph{aspect} 
    \item \emph{voice} of the sentence (\sans{prayoga}). There are two: active \sans{(kart.rprayoga)} and passive \sans{(karmanprayoga)} \ASK{is that the correct name?}. There is a variant of \sans{karmanprayoga} called \sans{bhaaveprayoga}.
    \item \emph{number} of agents in action (\sans{vacana}). There are \emph{three} numbers of agents: Singular \sans{(ekavacana)}, Dual \sans{(dvivacana)}, and Plural \sans{(bahuvacana)}. The use of Dual is \emph{mandatory} when exactly two agents are involved.
    \item \emph{person} of the sentence (\sans{puru.sa}). There are three: first \sans{(uttama)}, second \sans{(madhyama)}, and third \sans{(prathama)}.
\end{captionedlabeledlistenv}

It is helpful to talk about the terminations alone and present them in the tabular format described above. They suggest patterns for \sans{parasmaipada} and \sans{aatmanepada} roots. Note that the terminations are related to whether the verb is active or middle and are independent of the \sans{ga.na} of the root. Expository and grammar texts in \sans{sa.msk.rta} vary in placement of rows, but the columns are always in the same order: first column -- singular, second column -- dual, and third column -- plural. Some references show the first person \sans{(uttamapuru.sa)} forms in the first row and the third person \sans{(prathamapuru.sa)} in the third row whereas other references do the opposite. The second person \sans{(madhyamapuru.sa)} forms are shown in the second row. We will adopt the \textbf{third person, second person, and first person order $\downarrow$} in this document.

Table \ref{tab: active endings} shows the terminations of a \sans{parasmaipadii dhaatu} in the active voice and the present tense. We will list the same for \sans{aatmanepadii dhaatu} later \TODO{provide a link here}. We conventionally refer to a verb by its name followed by its present tense, active voice, third person, singular form. For example: \sans{gam - gacchati}, \sans{bhuu -- bhavati}, \sans{vand -- vandate}.

The general specification of the table of final verb forms is as shown in Table \ref{tab: specifying verb forms}.

Once the endings and the forms of a template \sans{dhaatu} are known, one can predict forms of other \sans{dhaatava.h} from the same \sans{ga.na}. 

\subsection{Formation of Simple Sentences}
Like verbs, nominal (noun, pronoun, and adjective) words have \emph{inflected forms} that are called \emph{cases} or \emph{declensions}. A case in \sans{sa.msk.rta} is \sans{vibhakti}. We shall see some details of cases in the next section (\TODO{link}). For now, just remember that there are 8 cases (numbered 1 through 8) each of which has a name and grammatical function. When an inflected form of a root nominal word (we have called the root word \sans{praatipadika}) corresponding to a case appears in a sentence, we often say that the root nominal word \emph{takes} that case (specified by name or number of the case) or it is \emph{in} that case.

In \sans{kart.rprayoga}, the agent or subject of a sentence is in the first or the \emph{nominative} case.

Nouns and pronouns, \emph{except the first and second person pronouns} have one of the three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The gender is purely \emph{grammatical and unpredictable} (also see \hyperlink{generic-gender}{generic gender}). The (third person) pronouns \sans{sa.h, saa, tat} roughly translate to \emph{he, she, it} respectively. However, gender may apply to inanimate objects as well. Thus, gender is a characteristic of the word, not of what it represents.

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
    \caption{Pronominal roots and their nominative forms}
    \label{tab: promominal roots}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
    Person & \sans{praatipadika} & Gender &Singular&Dual&Plural\\
    \hline
    Third \sans{(prathama)} & \sans{tad} & masculine &\sans{sa.h} (he) &\sans{tau} (they two) &\sans{te} (they)\\
    \hline
    Third \sans{(prathama)}& \sans{tad} & feminine &\sans{saa} (she) &\sans{te} (they two feminine) &\sans{taa.h} (they all feminine)\\
    \hline
    Third \sans{(prathama)}& \sans{tad} & neuter &\sans{tat} (it) &\sans{te} (they two neuter) &\sans{taani} (they all neuter)\\
    \hline
    Second \sans{(madhyama)}& \sans{yu.smad} & -- &\sans{tvam} (you) &\sans{yuvaam} (you two) &\sans{yuuyam} (you all)\\
    \hline
    First \sans{(uttama)}& \sans{asmad} & -- &\sans{aham} (I) &\sans{aavaam} (we two) &\sans{vayam} (we all)\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In an active voice sentence, the number and person of the agent agree with the verb. At this [preliminary] stage, the word order can be assumed to be grammatically unimportant. General order is, however, \textbf{agent (or subject) -- object -- verb}.

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sans{aha.m vadaami} or \sans{vadaami aham} -- I speak.
    \item \sans{saa vadati} or \sans{vadati saa} -- She speaks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vocabulary}

\paragraph{Verbs of \sans{1--pa ga.na}}

This \sans{ga.na} is known as the \sans{bhvaadiga.na} because the \emph{template} verbal root is the \sans{bhuu dhaatu}. We have said this before, but it is worth repeating: Inflected forms of a verb are based on whether the verb has active \sans{(parasmaipadii)} ending or middle \sans{(aatmanepadii)} ending; there is no \sans{(ubhayapadii)} \emph{ending}. A \sans{dhaatu}, on the other hand, may be \sans{ubhayapadii} which means that its inflected forms can take either an active ending or a middle ending.

There are precise rules governing the inflections that one studies when one takes up Pa.nini's Grammar \sans{(paa.niniiya vyaakara.nam)}. For now, memorization of these roots helps.

\section {Verb Conjugation Names}
Verb conjugations is \sans{sa.msk.rta} are complex. Even naming them is challenging. We found a verb \href{https://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktconjug.cgi?q=bhuu;c=1;font=deva}{conjugation engine} that is indeed very useful in this regard. Table \ref{tab: verb conjugations} shows the \sans{devanaagarii} names of various verb forms (including conjugations) and their corresponding English names.
